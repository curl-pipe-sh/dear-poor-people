# dear-poor-people

A collection of quick-and-dirty shell hacks pretending to be real tools.
Made for situations where you can't install the proper thing (no internet, no package manager, no compiler, no patience).

They're small, ugly, and barely work â€” but sometimes that's enough.

License: GPL-3.0, deal with it.
